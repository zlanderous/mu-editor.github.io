<h1>Mu Development</h1>

<p>Would you like to contribute to the development of Mu? (If you think this
is only something for experienced developers, please reconsider, there are
plenty of ways to contribute to Mu, no matter your level of experience or
skill set).</p>

<p>Our technical documentation is hosted on the wonderful
service that is <a href="https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/" target="_blank">Read the
Docs (http://mu.readthedocs.io/)</a>. Not only does it contain details needed
in order to make code
contributions to Mu, but it outlines plenty of other ways in which you can
contribute (including making updates to this website). Finally it provides a
guide to our processes and expectations for the various types of contribution
you can make to Mu.</p>

<p>The source code is <a href="https://github.com/mu-editor/mu">hosted on
GitHub</a>.</p>

<p>If in doubt, just <a href="/en/discuss">ask in our discussion area</a> and
someone will be able to point you in the right direction.</p>

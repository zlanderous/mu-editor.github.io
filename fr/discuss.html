<h1>Discuss Mu</h1>

<p>It's good to talk, share knowledge and learn from other users of Mu. Perhaps
you have a question, problem or are unsure how to do something with Mu?
Discussing such things in a supportive environment is a good way to make
progress, make friends and make a success of things. Put simply, Mu is a
community focused project and we have created an online discussion group
where the community can come together.</p>

<p>Contributions are welcome without prejudice from anyone irrespective of age,
gender, religion, race or sexuality. If youâ€™re thinking, "but they don't mean
me", then we especially mean YOU.</p>

<p>Our discussion platform is provided by a service called "Gitter" and you
can sign-up and connect with the community by clicking the button below or
visiting: <a href="https://gitter.im/mu-editor/general" target="_blank">https://gitter.im/mu-editor/general</a></p>
<p><a href="https://gitter.im/mu-editor/general" target="_blank" class="btn btn-primary btn-lg">Connect to Discussions</a></p>

<h4><strong>Community Conduct</strong></h4>
<p>We expect contributors to follow the Python Software foundation's
<a href="https://www.python.org/psf/codeofconduct/" target="_blank"><strong>Code of Conduct</strong></a>.</p>

<p>We won't hesitate to issue a clear warning and, if ignored, ban
people who don't behave in the spirit of the code of conduct. We want our
community to be a safe, welcoming and friendly place. If a conduct related
situation arises, we will endeavour to act in a discreet, sympathetic and fair
manner to all concerned.</p>

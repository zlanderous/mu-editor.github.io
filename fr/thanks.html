<h1>Mu Thanks <span class="glyphicon glyphicon-heart" aria-hidden="true" style="color: #c93827;"></span></h1>

<p class="lead">Mu would not be possible without the help and support of many
<a href="https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/authors.html">volunteer developers</a>
who give up their time to improve Mu. However, it is important to acknowledge the help and work of others who
may not be developers, those who make significant contributions or those whose work is essential for Mu. If you find Mu
useful, why not thank the following people and organisations? It takes
only a minute of your time to tweet your appreciation.</p>

    <p>Carrie Anne is the director of education at the 
    <a href="http://raspberrypi.org/">Raspberry Pi Foundation</a>.
    She gave a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_gU7sfTrz4c">keynote
    address</a> to the EuroPython 2015 conference in Bilbao
    where she set the assembled delegates some homework (once a teacher, always
    a teacher). She asked that we make a Python editor tailored to the needs
    of beginner programmers and based on the feedback she had received from
    the many teachers who had used a Raspberry Pi to teach Python. Many of the
    design decisions taken when making Mu are directly influenced by Carrie
    Anne's invaluable work and feedback. Thank you Carrie Anne, we hope Mu gets
    a good grade as our homework submission. :-)</p>

    <p>Dan Pope heard Carrie Anne's keynote address at EuroPython. Both he and
    I (Nicholas) took up the challenge to create a beginner-friendly editor,
    and while at the conference started to code up a
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PXfzfZzq1dc">very simple editor
    called Puppy</a>. Work stalled until, as a contribution to the BBC's
    <a href="http://microbit.org/">micro:bit</a> project, a native MicroPython
    editor was needed. The core of Puppy became the first steps to Mu. Thanks
    Dan for helping to make those first steps.</p>
    <p>Dan needs further thanks because he is also the creator and maintainer
    of <a href="https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Pygame Zero</a>,
    a Python library that makes it easy for beginner programmers to create
    games with Pygame. It forms the basis of Mu's Pygame Zero mode.</p>

    Python programming langauge for microcontroller based devices. Damien was
    instrumental in the success of MicroPython on the BBC micro:bit device and
    Adafruit's CircuitPython is based upon MicroPython.</p>
    <p>Mu was originally created as an editor for MicroPython on the BBC
    micro:bit and Damien contributed code to that made the REPL on
    an attached device available via Mu.</p>
    <p>Thanks Damien for your extraordinary work on MicroPython and your help
    with the early versions of Mu's REPL.</p>

    <p>Carlos has made significant contributions to Mu in several ways. First,
    he created and has maintained the automation involved in making versions of
    Mu available for download. Second, he has been invaluable in "housekeeping"
    efforts involved in the project: triaging bugs, closing outstanding issues,
    reviewing code and generally making the Mu development community a positive
    and friendly place. Finally, he has
    <a href="https://github.com/mu-editor/mu/graphs/contributors">contributed</a>
    huge numbers of bug fixes, features and re-factored code to Mu and the
    projects upon which it depends. Thank you Carlos for running with those
    tasks that are often overlooked or left unacknowledged. Mu wouldn't be
    the friendly project it is, without all your help.</p>

    <p>Zander, like Top Gear's

    a mystery. Nobody has ever met him in real life, and all interactions with
    Zander are via copious GitHub comments, pull requests and bug fixes. Some
    say he's an alien being from another dimension, others claim him to be
    a rogue artificial intellegince running rampant in random Git repositories,
    yet more people whisper in hushed tones that he's merely a pseudonym for
    Bill Gates, coming out of retirement to contribute to free software
    projects. All I can say is that I'm thankful for his considerable
    conributions to Mu's code base, eagle-eyed code reviews and seemingly
    limitless Pythonic knowledge.</p>

    <p>Tim is one of those rare legendary beasts of the coding world: a tame
    Python core developer. He specialises in Python on Windows and he has
    brought this invaluable knowledge to the development of Mu on many
    occasions. Since Mu is developed mainly on Linux, if Mu works well on
    Windows, it's probably because of Tim's intervention. Tim also makes
    considerable contributions to Python in education in the UK by helping to
    run workshops for kids and taking an active part in engaging with teaching
    colleagues. Again, Tim's considerable experience and knowledge resulting
    from such work is regularly brought to the development of Mu. Thank you
    Tim for all your hard work.</p>

    <p><a href="http://www.pixeldiva.co.uk/">Ann</a> is an exceptionally
    talented 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User_experience_design">"User
    eXperience" (UX</a>) researcher. Her passion for collaboratively
    putting users at the centre of an evidence based development process is
    both inspiring and the antidote to the naive "just build this list of
    features" approach to software project management.</p>
    
    <p>Ann's connection with Mu is advisorial in nature. She supported, advised
    and provided pointers at a crucial time in Mu's development. If the user
    interface feels simple and easy to use it's because Ann pointed the way to
    the approach to take for arriving at the interface. Another, more concrete
    example of Ann's contribution can be found in her written Q&amp;A
    responses that frame Mu's
    <a href="https://mu.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user-experience.html">developer documentation about UX</a>.
    Thank you Ann for your help, support and humour. Thank you for ensuring
    beginner programmers remain at the centre of Mu's development. Thank you

    great talent and passion for making software more accessible, especially
    for those with vision impairment or loss. He also spends a large part of
    his free time organising and running events to help kids learn to code. Ben
    has ensured that the text widget used by Mu (<a href="https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/qscintilla/intro">QScintilla</a>)
    has all the features needed to make it integrate with a computer's
    accessibility features (for example, a screen reader). Learning to code

    <h4 class="media-heading">Thomas Kluyver</h4>
    <p>Thomas should be thanked for two aspects of Mu. The REPL in Python3 mode
    is based on his
    <a href="https://qtconsole.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">qconsole</a> widget
    that makes it easy to integrate the amazing
    <a href="https://jupyter.org/">Jupyter Project</a> into Qt based apps like
    Mu. It was ridiculously easy to integrate into Mu and the powerful features
    it brings (reproducible computational narratives, embedded plots, automatic
    help, and other iPython related goodies) is a taste of things to come when
    students graduate to "proper" Jupyter notebooks. Thomas's other
    contribution is the Windows based installer built with his super-cool
    <a href="https://pynsist.readthedocs.io/en/latest/">Pynsist</a> tool for
    creating Windows installers for Python applications. I found a couple of
    bugs and had a few requests, and Thomas was very gracious to accept my
    suggested changes. The result is the super easy installer we have for
    Windows. Thank you Thomas! You rock!</p>

    <p>Ren&eacute; is the maintainer of the insanely wonderful
    <a href="https://www.pygame.org/news">Pygame</a> library for programming
    games with Python. He does an amazing job, as a volunteer, packaging,
    testing, fixing and generally keeping the development moving forward on
    what is an extraordinarily powerful and non-trivial project. Pygame is,
    of course, what sits behind Dan's Pygame Zero and this relationship
    encapsulates the Mu philosophy: you start with a simple tool (like Mu or
    Pygame Zero) which forms a bridge to "real" Python programming (be that
    a professional code editor or the Pygame library). It is only by sitting
    on the shoulders of giants like Ren&eacute; that we can build such
    beginner friendly tools. Finally, Ren&eacute;'s sense of playful fun,
    celebration of off the wall excentricity and general merry mischief 
    contributes to making Python such a wonderful community. Keep it up

    <p>Kushal is, quite simply, an inspiring figure in the Python community.
    His passion for facilitating education and learning is infectious and
    breathtaking: boundless enthusiasm and effort result in extraordinarily
    successful online and offline workshops for beginner programmers in his
    native India and beyond. So I was especially proud that Kushal found
    some of his precious time to help package Mu for
    <a href="https://getfedora.org/">Fedora</a> based Linux distributions. In
    this respect he was a path-finder since it was the first time Mu had been
    properly packaged. Kushal has also provided lots of moral support during
    the development of Mu, and I hope he finds a way to help me with a Hindi
    translation. Thank you Kushal!</p>

    <p>I first met Martin at PyCon UK where he single handedly presented a

    coders. To say that Martin has a gift for teaching is an understatement.
    His work and enthusiasm for empowering young people in the digital realm
    is inspiring and a joy to behold. Martin's contributions to Mu relate to
    his patient, comprehensive and incredibly useful testing of Mu on the
    various target platforms. He has also been a sympathetic and pro-active
    bridge between Mu development and the Raspberry Pi education team. His
    willingness to facilitate invaluable and crucial meetings between 
    developers and educators was a fundamental aspect of Mu's improvement in
    the later stages of its development. Thank you Martin, especially for your
    patience with all those bugs! :-)</p>

    20 million units shipped and a plethora of online content for beginner
    programmers, this plucky small computer is transforming computing education
    from an uninspiring exploration of office and productivity software into
    an exercise in digital empowerment.</p>
    
    <p>I felt very honoured when
    Carrie Anne got in touch to say that the Raspberry Pi Foundation were
    interested in supporting my work on Mu. The result has been a significant
    re-write and the addition of plenty of cool new features based upon the
    feedback of friends in the Raspberry Pi Foundation's education team and
    direct observation of beginner coders at several of Raspberry Pi's many
    Code Clubs here in the UK. Most importantly, Raspberry Pi should be
    congratulated and celebrated for putting their money where their mouth is:
    by supporting free software developers like myself, they are supporting the
    ecosystem and work of those upon whom they depend. Thank you for your
    support! I hope Mu helps you with your mission to change the world of
    computing education for the better.</p>

    Foundation</a> as a volunteer led contribution to the project.</p>
    <p>While Mu has never had any formal recognition by the Micro:bit project,
    the associated educational foundation funded work on updating the way Mu
    flashes <a href="https://micropython.org/">MicroPython</a> onto the device.
    The new method of flashing is almost instantaneous (to the extent that we
    had bug reports saying it didn't work, when in fact it worked so quickly

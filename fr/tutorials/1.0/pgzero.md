# Games with PyGame Zero

[PyGameZero](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) is a beginner
friendly wrapper around the powerful [PyGame](http://pygame.org/)
library for writing video games using Python. It's extraordinarily easy to
write an entertaining game in only a few lines of Python code with PyGameZero.
For example, the side scrolling chasing game shown in the video below is only
400 lines of Python which were written using Mu.

Mu's PyGameZero mode provides five buttons but we need only describe two:

The "Play" button knows how to start your game using the PyGameZero framework
and, once clicked, turns into a "Stop" button. When your game starts any
textual input or output will be contained in the pane added between the
text editor and Mu's footer. Most importantly, a new game window created by
PyGameZero will appear on your desktop. This makes it very easy to see, test
and check your game is working how you expected it to!

The remaining "Images", "Fonts", "Sounds" and "Music" buttons all work in
exactly the same way. Your game will need to include assets such as images (for
sprites, backgrounds and other things in your game), fonts (so you can write
text to the screen in your game), sounds (for sound effects to signal when
something has happened in your game) and music (to create an atmosphere for
your game). Clicking on each of the four buttons opens the directory into which
you should put such game assets (simply drag and drop things into them using
your operating system's file manager).

Once your game assets are in the right place, PyGameZero makes it
extraordinarily easy to use them in your game!

Now go [read the PyGameZero documentation](https://pygame-zero.readthedocs.io/en/stable/) and make something fun!

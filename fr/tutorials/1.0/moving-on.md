# Moving on from Mu

Mu was created to help you take your first steps in programming with Python.
We want you to learn all you can with Mu, but there will come a time when you
need to graduate to a more advanced code editor.

Here are some suggestions for what to explore next:

* [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) are an amazing way to create an
  interactive narrative with code, multi-media and traditional prose. The
  REPL in Python 3 mode is a simplified version of a Jupyter notebook, so
  project Jupyter should immediately feel familiar. They also have a
  wonderfully friendly community.
* [Atom](https://atom.io/) is a free and simple code editor with lots of
  useful *optional* features. Made by the folks at GitHub, it works with many
  different programming languages and on all the platforms supported by Mu.
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is a powerful yet easy
  to use cross platform code editor for many different programming languages.
  Microsoft have done a great job in supporting Python and
  you'll find it comes with more advanced versions of all the features of Mu.
* [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) is advertised as a Python
  IDE (integrated development environment -- i.e. it has lots of bells and
  whistles) for professional developers. Apparently there is a simplified
  educational version, although I've heard mixed reviews from teachers about
  how good it is.

Finally, please remember that creating software is a collaborative process.
Be open to the ideas of others, show respect for their time, efforts and
feelings and be considerate to your peers.

Good luck! :-)

# Using Modes

Mu is a modal editor.

All this means is that Mu behaves differently depending on the currently
selected mode. Modes make it easy to customise the way Mu behaves while also
simplifying Mu: rather than trying to provide every possible feature all at
once, modes organise related features and capabilities together.

As you need to use different sorts of features, change modes by simply clicking
on the "Modes" button (shown below) found as the top left button in Mu.

Simple!

<div class="row">
  <img src="/img/en/tutorials/mode_button.png" alt="The Mode button" class="img-responsive center-block img-rounded movie"/>
  <br/>
</div>

Once clicked a menu, like the one shown below, allows you to select the mode
you wish to use. Just double-click on the required mode, or highlight the mode
and click OK. If you want to back out, click cancel.

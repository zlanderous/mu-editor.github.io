# How to think your way around a problem in code

You learn to code in order to make stuff that you find important. Often this is
called "scratching your itch" (where the itch is your particular passion).
Perhaps you have a great idea for a goofy game, maybe you've thought of a
way to improve people's lives through helpful technology or you may just want
to program a computer to do something just for you.

No matter what, you're going to have to turn your raw idea into something that
works. Here's the good news: so long as you don't need to break the laws of
nature, given enough time and effort, anything is possible. The bad news is
that while something may be possible, it doesn't mean that it's easy or even
worth the effort. Furthermore, you may not have the time or resources required
to make the thing that you want, nor even realise how much time or effort
is needed.

How do you make a start? How do you make sure you're doing the right thing?
How do you know when you're done?

There are no right answers to these questions because each project is
different and the people involved are all different. However, the following
advice may help you learn the answers for your project with your collaborators.

## What's the Problem?

## Who's the User?

## Why your Solution?

## Has this been done Before?
